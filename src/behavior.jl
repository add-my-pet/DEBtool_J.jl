    AbstractBehavior

Abstract supertype for organism behaviors.

Behaviors respond to physiological state and external stimuli,
to either control *exposure* to the external stimuli, or modify
physiological parameters to change the *effect* of the external stimuli.

- Response to environmental information that leads to:
    - Changes in metabolic parameters
    - Changes in the environment or position within the environment

Abstract supertype behaviors that modify location based
on inforation from the environment, such as moving up into
cooler air or moving underground into a warmer/cooler burror.
